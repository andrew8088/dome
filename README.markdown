# Dome: A Simple DOM Library

Dome is a simple DOM library. I wrote it for a Nettuts+ tutorial "Building your First JavaScript Library." It's not meant to be a complete DOM library, but a simple example of some of the things you have to consider when writing a JavaScript library.

Check out the [tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/build-your-first-javascript-library/), and then feel free to fork it and try extending it. Don't forget to send pull requests!
